# New rules

From now on, all your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form,
unless explicitely stated otherwise. Then, they will implement the four required member
functions below:
>
* Default constructor
  >
* Copy constructor
  >
* Copy assignment operator
  >
* Destructor
  >
Split your class code into two files. The header file (.hpp/.h) contains the class
definition whereas the source file (.cpp) contains the implementation.

# ex00 : My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
* Turn-in directory : ex00/
* Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
* Forbidden functions : None

You think you know integers and floating-point numbers. How cute.

Please read this 3 pages article ([1](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/floating_point/understanding_floating_point.html), [2](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/floating_point/understanding_floating_point_representation.html) [3](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/floating_point/understanding_floating_point_printing.html)) to discover that you don’t. Go on, read it.

Until today, every number you used in your code was basically either an integer or a
floating-point number, or any of their variants (short, char, long, double, and so forth).
After reading the article above, it’s safe to assume that integers and floating-point numbers have opposite caracteristics.
>

But today, things will change. You are going to discover a new and awesome number
type: __fixed-point numbers!__ Forever missing from the scalar types of most languages,
fixed-point numbers offer a valuable balance between performance, accuracy, range and
precision. That explains why fixed-point numbers are particularly applicable to computer
graphics, sound processing or scientific programming, just to name a few.
>

As C++ lacks fixed-point numbers, you’re going to add them. [This article](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp06/handout/fixedpt.html) from
Berkeley is a good start. If you have no idea what Berkeley University is, read [this
section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley#Notable_alumni.2C_faculty.2C_and_staff) of its Wikipedia page.

Create a class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents a fixed-point number:
>
* Private members:
  >
  *An integer to store the fixed-point number value.
  >
  *A static constant integer to store the number of fractional bits. Its value
  >
will always be the integer literal 8.
>
* Public members:
  >
  *A default constructor that initializes the fixed-point number value to 0.
  >
  *A copy constructor.
  >
  *A copy assignment operator overload.
  >
  *A destructor.
  >
  *A member function int getRawBits( void ) const;
  >
that returns the raw value of the fixed-point value.
>
  *A member function void setRawBits( int const raw );
  >
that sets the raw value of the fixed-point number.
>
Running this code:
>

```
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
Fixed a;
Fixed b( a );
Fixed c;
c = b;
std::cout << a.getRawBits() << std::endl;
std::cout << b.getRawBits() << std::endl;
std::cout << c.getRawBits() << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
Should output something similar to:
>

```

# ex01 : Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
* Turn-in directory : ex01/
* Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
* Allowed functions : roundf (from <cmath>)

The previous exercise was a good start but our class is pretty useless. It can only
represent the value 0.0.
Add the following public constructors and public member functions to your class:
* A constructor that takes a constant integer as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is
initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
* A constructor that takes a constant floating-point number as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is
initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
* A member function float toFloat( void ) const;
that converts the fixed-point value to a floating-point value.
* A member function int toInt( void ) const;
that converts the fixed-point value to an integer value.
And add the following function to the Fixed class files:
* An overload of the insertion («) operator that inserts a floating-point representation
of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as parameter.

Running this code:

```
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
Fixed a;
Fixed const b( 10 );
Fixed const c( 42.42f );
Fixed const d( b );
a = Fixed( 1234.4321f );
std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl;
std::cout << "b is " << b << std::endl;
std::cout << "c is " << c << std::endl;
std::cout << "d is " << d << std::endl;
std::cout << "a is " << a.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "b is " << b.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "c is " << c.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "d is " << d.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
Should output something similar to:

```
$> ./a.out
Default constructor called
Int constructor called
Float constructor called
Copy constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
Float constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
Destructor called
a is 1234.43
b is 10

d is 10
a is 1234 as integer
b is 10 as integer
c is 42 as integer
d is 10 as integer

# ex02 : Now we’re talking
* Turn-in directory : ex02/
* Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
* Allowed functions : roundf (from <cmath>)

Add public member functions to your class to overload the following operators:
* The 6 comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, == and !=.
* The 4 arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /.
* The 4 increment/decrement (pre-increment and post-increment, pre-decrement and
post-decrement) operators, that will increase or decrease the fixed-point value from
the smallest representable ϵ such as 1 + ϵ > 1.
Add these four public overloaded member functions to your class:
* A static member function min that takes as parameters two references on fixed-point
numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
* A static member function min that takes as parameters two references to constant
fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
* A static member function max that takes as parameters two references on fixed-point
numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.
* A static member function max that takes as parameters two references to constant
fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.

It’s up to you to test every feature of your class. However, running the code below:

```
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
Fixed a;
Fixed const b( Fixed( 5.05f ) * Fixed( 2 ) );
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << ++a << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << a++ << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << b << std::endl;
std::cout << Fixed::max( a, b ) << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
Should output something like (for greater readability, the constructor/destructor messages are removed in the example below):
```
$> ./a.out
0
0.00390625
0.00390625
0.00390625
0.0078125
10.1016
10.1016
$>
```
If you ever do a division by 0, it is acceptable that the program
crashes

# ex03 : BSP
* Turn-in directory : ex03/
* Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp,
* Point.{h, hpp}, Point.cpp, bsp.cpp
* Allowed functions : roundf (from <cmath>)
Now that you have a functional Fixed class, it would be nice to use it.
Implement a function which indicates whether a point is inside of a triangle or not.
Very useful, isn’t it?
BSP stands for Binary space partitioning. You are welcome. :)
You can pass this module without doing exercise 03.

Let’s start by creating the class Point in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents
a 2D point:
* Private members:
  *A Fixed const attribute x.
  *A Fixed const attribute y.
  *Anything else useful.
* Public members:
  *A default constructor that initializes x and y to 0.
  *A constructor that takes as parameters two constant floating-point numbers. It initializes x and y with those parameters.
  * A copy constructor.
  * A copy assignment operator overload.
  * A destructor.
  * Anything else useful.
To conclude, implement the following function in the appropriate file:
bool bsp( Point const a, Point const b, Point const c, Point const point);
* a, b, c: The vertices of our beloved triangle.
* point: The point to check.
* Returns: True if the point is inside the triangle. False otherwise.
Thus, if the point is a vertex or on edge, it will return False.
Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure that your class behaves as expected.
